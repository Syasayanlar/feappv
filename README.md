FEAPpv -- free personal version of the FEAP

This version of FEAP is available for free.  It is directly modeled after FEAP but does not contain all of its features, such as a parallel capability, contact, fe2, igafeap, and a number of other advanced features.  Its architecture is generally similar to FEAP's but often is a bit behind in programming style.  Some additional details can be found at http://projects.ce.berkeley.edu/feap/feappv.

For information on FEAP see http://projects.ce.berkeley.edu/feap

There is a FEAP and FEAPpv forum at http://feap.berkeley.edu and there is a nacient wiki at http://feap.berkeley.edu/wiki
